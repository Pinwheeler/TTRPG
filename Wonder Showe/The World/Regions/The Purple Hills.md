## Description
Long stretch of beautiful rolling countryside. Many hobbages stutter the landscape, each boasting the local terroir that produces their particular vintage. Any area that isn't devoted to wine cultivation is covered by natural purple wildflowers that have some economic value.

| Eyes   | Hills of purple flowers as far as the eye can see           |
| Ears   | Wind blowing through the flowers                            |
| Nose   | Faint smell of ripening grapes if the season is good for it |
| Taste  |                                                             |
