# Description
Port Kir was a busy port with harbors being the town's lifeblood. It was significantly smaller, simpler, and impressively utilitarian compared to the bloated and splendorous ports of the southern merchant nations. Port Kir was scented by [fish oil](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Fish_oil "Fish oil"), and bigger Tethyrean settlements looked down on the Seacity, despite heavy reliance on fresh and [saltfish](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Saltfish "Saltfish") produced by the port.

A tightly-packed big block of more than a dozen three-story buildings stood past the docks. These were warehouses and guildhalls belonging to many guilds of Port Kir. The biggest warehouse at the front of the block belonged to the Fishermen's and Fishmongers' Guild
