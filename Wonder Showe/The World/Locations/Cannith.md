## Description
![house_cannith_insignia](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/eberron/images/b/bf/Dragonmarked_House_COA_Cannith.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20220509100729)
at the bottom of a valley is a shocking ruin. Where there was once stone walls creating the exteriors of several buildings is now simply "gone." A shallow crater, now filled with grasses and purple hills flora falls directly in line with the missing architecture. There is an air of foul magics about.

This ruined husk of the once proud house Cannith is the site of an aetheric disturbance. Abberations and the undead wander about, sometimes triggering remaining technomechanical traps and automated sentries.

There is likely to be some decent magic here in some of the harder-to-reach places
