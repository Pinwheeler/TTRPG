# Description
The city rightly sees itself as the “quieter but better” trade rival to [[Baldur’s Gate]], [[Waterdeep]], [[Calimport]], and the other cities of [[Tethyr]]

The high water table of Zazesspur means that there is nowhere to build but up. Cellars are almost completely unheard of and more than one noble family has lost their estate simply by digging down.

Population has shrunk to 100,000 down from its previous stable max of 350,000. This means that many of the buildings that have "been scupped", a local phrase for some construction project bursting the water table simply stand abandoned. 

An important role is that of the Goshawk. The Goshawk runs a team of druids that encourage hawks and owls to roost in various areas of the city in order to cut down on pests.

The "Rods" are the enforcement of the city. They direct traffic with colored wands that earn their namesake.

the Merchant Dukes enthusiastically agree with the Crown on at least one thing: they want a green, growing city where they can eat fresh vegetables and herbs plucked from their own balconies and windows; as has been the case for centuries, Zazesspur imports grain and livestock to fill local meal-platters

Zazess like to gamble, like roast boar as part of their cuisine, prefer their fish only in sauces and hot-tureen-stews, and like round beds and round tables. Thanks to morning fogs and frequent light rain showers, hooded weather cloaks, and stylish boots dominate fashion here.

| Eyes   | Several buildings of moderate esteem stand empty                                                            |
| Ears   | The sound of burbling water seems to pervade everywhere. Various dialects catch your ear                    |
| Nose   | The city smells constantly of petrichor                                                                     |
| Taste  |                                                                                                             |
| Body   | The smooth dressed-stone-slab sidewalks are a novelty. You are unconcerned about tripping in these streets. |
