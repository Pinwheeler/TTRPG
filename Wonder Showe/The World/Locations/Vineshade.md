# Description

Great Halfling bastion. The cliff-faces around the central lake are riddled with halfling apartments. The total population is unknown as a constant tradition of "visiting" is practiced amongst the folk here. Some halflings boast about not having been back to their own home in months.

An underground network of tunnels connects the city center with outlying farms which serve as rallying points for the [[Vineguard]] who defended the city twice during the Tethyrian Interregnum

The city is arguably the most important wine-producing city on the coast with [[Neverwinter]] being the only other rival.
